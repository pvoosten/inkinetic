Convert an Inkscape drawing to an HTML5 canvas, originally using only the Kinetic JS library.

Why?
----
Many people have creative ideas for their own postcard, flyers, ... which they
can't realize because they lack the technical skills to convert their idea
to printable or web-viewable form.

I want to be of service to such people. I'm not the greatest artist in the world, I don't always have the best ideas, but I can realize the ideas of other people.

How?
----
Well, I need to be flexible and do print stuff and web stuff with the same tools. I like to use Inkscape, which can export to PDF. Since API support is better developed for HTML canvas than for SVG, I like to convert the Inkscape SVG to canvas. I can further easily add interactivity and animation to the web form of the creation.

What?
-----
A code generator that converts SVG to Javascript files that draw the content of the SVG on a canvas.
